## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The automation is initiated from the Appilot dashboard where the user uploads story media and sets posting time or frequency.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot connects to Android devices (via UI Automator or Accessibility services), navigates to the Threads app, and opens the story upload section.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” The bot uploads selected media, applies captions or mentions, and posts it as a story automatically.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Error handling, proxy rotation, and analytics logging ensure smooth operation and reliable posting across multiple accounts.
